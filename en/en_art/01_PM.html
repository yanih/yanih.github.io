            <h1>Monogenic meets Polygenic variants in CVD risk </h1>

				When we are considering the overall effects from multi-or-two genetic variants, we normally hypothesized three possibilities:<br>
				(1) additive: independently contribute to the phenotype that their combination effect is equal to the sum of individual effects;<br>
				(2) non-additive and dominant: their combination effect is not equal to the sum of individual effects and genetic variants are alleles from one locus;<br>
				(3) non-additive and interactive: their combination effect is not equal to the sum of individual effects and genetic variants are from different loci.<br>

				Take cardiovascular disease for example. Studies have discovered that even the FH carriers have diverse risks of CVD which should be equal according Mendelian inheritance.
				In this paper the authors hypothesized that this incomplete penetrance from monogenic variants may be partly explained by the different dosages of polygenic variants. 
				They later partitioned the participants by polygenic dosages to see the risk gradients among FH carriers, as well as non-carriers (negative control).
				There is indeed a trend between CVD risk and polygenic dosage in FH carriers. And the gap between FH carriers and non-carriers changed 
				very slightly with the increase of polygenic dosages, meaning the additive relationship and non-existence of interaction.<br>
				
				That is a very interesting work. We can only see outcomes/risks from the surface which is the overall effects of multiple factors. 
				And taking into account together the roles that seemly contradictory is very important. 
				A man can develop a CVD event because of mutation from FH genes and a lot of minor variants simultaneously.

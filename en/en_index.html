			<h2>About blog</h2>
				
				<h3>· Inspiration</h3>
					<p>I take myself as a creative person. I wish there could be a place comletely belonging to myself to hold thoughts. At the same time,
						I want to make up my deficiency in logical thinking. Later I found building a blog by myself may meet both of the two needs, so I started to establish the webpage by myself.</p>
						
						<p>
						I browsed many excellent programmers' blogs, two of which inspired me again, profoundly : 
						<a href="https://yihui.org/" target="_blank">Yihui Xie</a> and
						 <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/vamei/" target="_blank">Vamei</a>.
						The former taught me to keep track of life experiences seriously; 
						the latter gave me the bravey to genuinely write myself down.
						</p>
					</p>
						
						
				<h3>· Establishment</h3>		
					<p>
						
						I learn web-DIY by doing. Though I am a clumsy learner, I do enjoying making something new by myself, espeacilly with things are cool and mysterious.
						Basically HTML and CSS are enough to build a simple place like this, but I'll decorate it with some hand draw pictures and Javascript in the future. And I want to try Django as my backend framework. Ok,OK, don't be hurry...I am working on it.<br>
					
						<p>Notice: I grabbed Yihui's CSS stylesheet at first in order to get a quick understanding of web framework by imitation
							(I still use his font style and some layout ideas, thanks a lot). But I do not recommend this kind of attempt either because the finished web construction reflects individual's specific mindset and sometimes it can
							be rather sophisticated for a novice to read. It will be more efficient to realize your designing ideas step by step. 
							</p>
					</p>
				<h3>· Intention</h3>
					<p>
						In the Chinese part, I will focus on literature\causal writing.<br>
						I will put my professional experiences mainly in the English zone.<br>
						Japanese pages will be learning process of this language and its culture.<br>

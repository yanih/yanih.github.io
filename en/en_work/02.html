                    Programming starts at the moment of combining your ultimate goal and what you are typing in. I mean, during the study of such a new thing for me, the 'aha!' moment is extremely important. It was the second when I can use the tools that I just learned to realize my desirable results, that I felt the magic power of programming. 
                    So I like the function of 'print', which shows my step by step outcome and guide me to the final milestone.<br>
                    Anthother interesting thing I found in Python is its amicable nature in speech. I am learning 'regular expression * +' today, and the word 'greedy' used to describe taking as larger as possible part in a string. This metaphor is saying to me: "ok, I'll take the big thing, I admit that I am a pushy wildcard".
